https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-visiting-all-points/

approach: iterate through every point and find abs diff in them like x2-x1 and y2-y1 then calculate max diff in the points to obtain ans 

class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int time = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<points.size()-1; i++)
        {
            int temp1 = abs(points[i+1][0] - points[i][0]);
            int temp2 = abs(points[i+1][1] - points[i][1]);
            time += max(temp1, temp2);
        }
        return time;
    }
};
